                    Orphaned as a child when his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash, Peter Parker was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. He was a very gifted child in terms of academics, but was very socially awkward and shy and was hence a victim of bullying. When he was 15, he was attending a science fair and was bit by a radioactive spider which gave him the proportional strength and agility of a spider and the ability to cling to walls. He also gained a sixth sense which he calls his spidey sense which warns of any danger.

                    With an agent, a costume, and a new name, Spider-Man became an overnight sensation on television. Unconcerned with the rest of the world, he vowed to use his powers only to take care of himself and his aunt and uncle. After his first TV special ended, he allowed a burglar that he could have easily restrained to run past him and escape. A few days later, Peter returned home to find his beloved Uncle Ben had been shot and killed. When Spider-Man confronted the killer hiding in the old Acme Warehouse at the waterfront, he discovered to his horror that his uncle's murderer was the burglar he apathetically allowed to pass. Consumed with guilt, he became aware at last that with great power comes great responsibility, just as his beloved uncle had once said.
